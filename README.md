a onedrive like but opensource free and simple to edit and security to the max ! 1.0 release  09/14/2025  8:00 PM reported to the 09/22/2025

there will be bugs (I know so be patient or talk to me by discord "caperuisseau") 

there are two bugs in 1.0 : when you modify a file it may take up more space but it will not count in the storage and when the name is too long the buttons go out of the box
