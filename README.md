a onedrive like but opensource free and simple to edit and security to the max ! 1.1 release in less than 10 years(not sure)

there will be bugs (I know so be patient or talk to me by discord "caperuisseau") 

there are two bugs in 1.0 : when you modify a file it may take up more space but it will not count in the storage and when the name is too long the buttons go out of the box

NO MAC VERSION (who use a mac btw like there are mid laptop bruh)
